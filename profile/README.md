The Breezy team is responsible for maintaining the Breezy project and
associated Python and Rust modules.

Most of our development actually happens on
[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/), in the
[Breezy](https://launchpad.net/breezy) project over there. Source code is mirrored
here on GitHub for convenience.
